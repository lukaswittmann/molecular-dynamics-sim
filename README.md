Molecular dynamics simulator I programmed in order to understand MD in more detail. Periodic boundary conditions, energy minimizer, thermostat and barostat, aswell as a correct physical scale and forcefields for the noble gasses are already implemented and working well. Future steps will include parallelization of the calculation of particle interactions and maybe introducing electrostatics and complex molecules like water.
